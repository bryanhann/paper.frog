prj.frog

The goal of this project is to develop programming skills
by implementing the game of Frog.  The game is explained
in the file [Frog.md]. 

Development first takes place in an interactive python3
shell, e.g. ipython3. Development should meet these
milestones:

    1. Support board creation and initialization.
    2. Support peek and swap functions.
    3. Support game logic to allow user to solve puzzle.
    4. Recognize a winning state and congratulate the user.

Subsequent milestones might be:
    2. Support run on its own, without ipython.
    4. Support the undoing of moves.
    3. Be colorful.

There is no intelligence at this point. An intelligent 
program would be able to look at a board configuration
and determine whether a win is still possible. A still
more intelligent program would be able to solve the 
puzzle for the user.

Which is to say: even this simple case of a simple Frog
game has the potential to be developed in interesting 
ways that will be challanging and educational for the
beginning programmer.
