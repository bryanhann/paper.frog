prj.frog

The goal of this project is to develop programming skills
by implementing the game of Frog.  The game is explained
in the file [Frog.md]. 

Currently there is support for piece stepping moves, but
not jumping moves. Once code is written and tested for
jumping moves, we will have reached the first milestone:
A program that will let the user actually solve a puzzle.

After that, the tentative milestones for the project is
that the program should:
    1. Recognize a winning state and congratulate the user.
    2. Be runnable on its own, without ipython.
    4. Support the undoing of moves.
    3. Be colorful.

There is no intelligence at this point. An intelligent 
program would be able to look at a board configuration
and determine whether a win is still possible. A still
more intelligent program would be able to solve the 
puzzle for the user.

Which is to say: even this simple case of a simple Frog
game has the potential to be developed in interesting 
ways that will be challanging and educational for the
beginning programmer.
